#BDE Tools

This repository contains a collection of useful tools to help with the
development of [BDE libraries](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde),
including:

* [Waf-Based Build System](http://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/wiki/Waf-Build)
* [bde_verify](http://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/wiki/bde_verify)

##Waf-Based Build System

This repository provides a system, based on
[waf](https://code.google.com/p/waf/), for building code whose source files are
organized according to the
[BDE Style](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/wiki/BDE-Style-Repository).
This is the tool used to build the
[BDE libraries](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde).

For detail documentation, please see the
[Waf Build System Wiki](http://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/wiki/Waf-Build)
